## Log

### 2026-10-08 — Project set up
- Added CLAUDE.md, docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md, docs/FEATURES_AND_DATA.md, this file.
- Next: milestone 1 (collector, dataset loaders, dedup, domain + time splits, data card).

### 2026-10-08 — Design change: pooled best-practical detector (docs only)
- Changed: CLAUDE.md, docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md, docs/FEATURES_AND_DATA.md rewritten for the new goal
  (pooled sources, own feature engine, platform masking, depth rule for PhiUSIIL legit, tiers A/B/C with
  stacking, runtime layers incl. optional LLM, corrected feeds, 10-split evaluation with negative
  controls). Added "Lessons from prior work" to PROJECT_SPEC.md citing report sections.
  Moved the prior report to docs/prior_work/representation_sensitivity_report.pdf.
- Superseded: the old E1/E2/E3 experiment plan and milestone list. Milestone 1 code (PR #1) is kept
  as a base but has known conflicts with the new rules (listed in the plan).
- Next: revised plan for approval, then milestone 1 (schema + loaders + dedup + depth check).
- Open questions: meaning of "dedupe by registrable domain across all sources"; access to the prior
  study's crawler pools, natural legitimate harvest and platform list; exact deadline.
