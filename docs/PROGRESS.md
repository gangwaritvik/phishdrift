# Progress log

Append an entry at the end of every task. Newest at the bottom. Keep entries short.

## Status

- Current milestone: 1 — Data ready (code done; needs a real data run)
- Deadline: about 3 weeks from 2026-10-02 (confirm)

## Open decisions

- Exact deadline date
- Brand list for squatting features (which Indian banks / payment apps)
- Whether to attempt Tier 4 (brand matching) or keep it as future work

## Log

### 2026-10-08 — Project set up
- Added CLAUDE.md, docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md, docs/FEATURES_AND_DATA.md, this file.
- Next: milestone 1 (collector, dataset loaders, dedup, domain + time splits, data card).

### 2026-10-07 — Milestone 1 code: collector, loaders, dedup, splits, data card
- Changed: Python project (`pyproject.toml`, ruff, pytest, CI in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`),
  `configs/{collector,datasets,splits}.yaml`, shared `phishdrift/` (schema, eTLD+1, cached HTTP client),
  `collector/` (OpenPhish, PhishTank, URLhaus, Tranco benign + inner pages, first-seen index),
  `data_pipeline/` (PhreshPhish, PhiUSIIL, live-feed loaders; exact + SimHash near-dup dedup;
  domain-disjoint random and time splits; data card), 67 tests in `tests/`.
- Decisions: eTLD+1 honours PSL private suffixes (each `*.github.io` site is its own domain).
  Near-dup HTML is removed within a label only, so phishing clones of real pages are kept.
  URLs labelled both phishing and benign are dropped. Time split drops test rows whose domain is in
  train. PhiUSIIL has no per-row dates, so it gets only the random split. URLhaus rows are tagged
  `threat=malware` and excluded from the `live` dataset unless `include_threats` adds them.
  Each dataset is split separately (no mixing sources, which would let a model learn the dataset).
- Results: none on real data yet. Code was built in a sandbox without access to the feeds, Hugging
  Face or UCI; tested with fixtures and a synthetic end-to-end run.
- Next: run `python -m data_pipeline inspect phreshphish` and fix `phreshphish.columns` in
  `configs/datasets.yaml` if names differ; run `python -m data_pipeline build`; schedule the
  collector daily; commit `reports/data_card.md`; then milestone 2 (URL features + E1).
- Open questions: PhishTank key availability; whether PhreshPhish's own date column is the
  collection date we want for the time split; confirm deadline date.
